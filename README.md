##Java Code##

This is our team's code repository, used to store our robot code. Branches can be used for testing features. Be sure to understand git fully before making changes.

##Rules##

When working in this repository, be sure to commit to the correct branch. Branches are set up so that sub-teams can work on their own piece of the program, without being bothered by merging and fast-forward updates.

##How we organize the repository##

Branches have been revamped to three main branches. Descriptions are available below.

###Branches###
There are 3 branches. These branches are organized in a way that different sub-teams can work on code individually pretty well.
It is worth noting that all branches use underscore letters, and they are capitalized just to look nicer.

* **Depreciated**: Used to store history of master. Is usually one of two commits behind master. does not serve any purpose other than letting master get messed up and being able to rebase master to its preferred configuration.
* **Master**: Our basic master branch. Every time we achieve functional robot code in the _testing_ branch, it will be pushed up to master.
* **Testing**: Used to make features that are not verified to have worked yet. This will be the most commonly used branch to use when testing.
