This package is used for all Autonomous modes (NOT Autonomous || AutonomousMode
- those are dispatch), autonomous settings / configurations and script reading
code. This is where the autonomous sub-team works.

Feel free to delete this file when you add stuff into this folder. This file is
here mostly just because git only commits folders with stuff inside of them.
