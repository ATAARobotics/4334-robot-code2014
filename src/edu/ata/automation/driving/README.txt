This package should be used for ALL driving code. This includes speed controllers,
control, joysticks and more. Manipulation (Arms, shooters, etc.) is also done
here. Please organize this package well, because it could get cluttered.

Note : Any type of algorithm / tracking / math function you use should not be here.
Put them in edu.ata.vision (Vision & Algorithm branch).

Feel free to delete this file when you add stuff into this folder. This file is
here mostly just because git only commits folders with stuff inside of them.
